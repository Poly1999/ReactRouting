# React Routing (React Router Dom v7)

## Description

In this project, I studied and practiced **routing** in a React application using **React Router Dom v7**.  
The project covers both basic and advanced routing concepts, working with private routes, navigation history, programmatic navigation, and lazy loading of components.

## What I Learned and Implemented

### 1. Routing Basics

- Understanding **URL** structure.
- Installing and using the **React Router** library.
- Creating basic routing with `<Routes>` and `<Route>`.

### 2. Nested Routes

- Using the `<Outlet>` component for rendering nested routes.
- Structuring pages and components efficiently.

### 3. Navigation

- Using `<Link>` and `<NavLink>` for page navigation.
- Programmatic navigation with `useNavigate()` and `navigate`.
- Getting the current route information using `useLocation()`.

### 4. Working with Navigation History

- Managing browser navigation history.
- Redirecting users and handling conditional navigation.

### 5. Private Routes

- Creating **protected routes** that are accessible only to authenticated users.
- Redirecting unauthorized users to the login page.

### 6. Lazy Loading

- Loading components on demand using `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`.
- Optimizing application performance and reducing initial load time.
